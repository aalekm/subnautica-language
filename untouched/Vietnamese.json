    "EncyDesc_CuteFish": "A small, gray-colored herbivore, the cuddlefish displays high levels of intelligence, curiosity and attachment. Strangely this species has not been encountered in the wild, and the scanned specimen had to be artificially hatched within an alien containment unit. \n\n1. Lifecycle:\nIn the absence of wild specimens little can be known for certain about the cuddlefish's lifecycle. It is possible that environmental conditions have changed, forcing the species to the edge of extinction, and leaving its eggs in permanent stasis. It is also possible the cuddelfish has been genetically altered, or even imported to 4546B from another world.\n\n2. Behavior:\nWe do know that the cuddlefish is a herbivore which displays highly social behavior in its interspecies interactions. As was observed in earth dolphins before their extinction, this creature seems to understand the concept of other minds, the prime indicator of true sentience, and attempts to communicate with a series of chirps and chirrups.\n\n3. Interaction:\nEvidence suggests the cuddlefish is capable of understanding and following simple commands, in addition to assessing the emotional state of individuals around it and responding in kind.\n\nAssessment: Emotional connection between living creatures is an essential component of psychological health",

Providing a substantial meal to would-be predators, the gasopod protects its domain by filling the surrounding water with poisonous and corrosive pods whose contents dissolve even synthetic fibers.\n\n1. Filtration System: \nThick, non-reactive skin and multiple gill layers render this creature impervious to the noxious acid clouds it produces.\n\n2. Algae Gland:\nA bulbous, sack-like appendage on the rear end. A luminescent yellow algae grows inside the sack and produces the poisonous compound. Abdominal muscles can contract, causing the algae gland to emit the noxious compound into the surrounding water.\n\n3. Large Pelvic Fins:\nCapable of powerful movement through the water when moving in small herds.\n\n4. Behavior:\nGasopods appear to be social in nature, and may even use their emissions in their relationship rituals. Their audible calls are likely signifiers of nearby threats, or food sources.\n\nAssessment: Approach with caution - Acidic pods may be retrieved and re-purposed",

Specialized Olfactory Antenna:\nEmployed in detection of bodily fluids in the water at impressive range.\n\n2. Secondary Pair of Eyes:\nLikely dedicated to detecting the peripheral movement of larger predators, and hungry members of its own species. \n\n3. Overdeveloped Tail Fin:\nFavors out-pacing and outnumbering their prey over individual maneuverability. Calculations suggest creatures up to 100x the biter's body weight could succumb to a focused assault by a pack of ten.\n \nAssessment: Avoid packs - Try not to bleed",
    "Ency_Stalker": "C\u00e1 tr\u00ecnh m\u00f5m d\u00e0i",
    "EncyDesc_Stalker": "A streamlined predator encountered in the kelp forests in wait of prey leaving the safety of the shallows to feed. The stalker likely carved out its evolutionary niche at the sweet spot between speed and size millions of years ago, and may be one of the oldest species on the planet.\n\nThe stalker appears to be attracted to titanium deposits, which tends to sharpen and put stress on its teeth.\n\nAs with many predators, it may be possible to temporarily distract hungry stalkers by feeding them.\n\n1. Teeth:\nThe stalker's teeth are unusually hard, and fast-growing. Its elongated snout can deliver huge biting pressure to larger attackers, while also being used to reach small herbivores seeking refuge amongst the rocks.\n\n2. Night-vision:\nRetinal layering on the eyeball suggests adaptation for night-time hunting.\n\n3. Dorsal Ridges:\nThese ridges can be moved independently to deliver superior maneuverability.\n\n4. Pelvic Fins:\nLong and powerful, the stalker has evolved to hunt the fastest of prey.\n \nAssessment: Stalker teeth may have applications in enameled glass fabrication",
    "Ency_SandShark": "Sand Shark",
    "EncyDesc_SandShark": "A powerful, medium-sized predator that burrows into the sand and ambushes its prey from below. As with many predators it may be possible to temporarily distract sand sharks by feeding any hungry specimens that draw close.\n\n1. Forward Dorsal Fin:\nThe unusual location of this fin suggests a purpose unrelated to movement through the water. It may be employed in shifting sand beneath the surface, or in mating rituals, or may simply be an evolutionary dead end.\n\n2. Segmented Exoskeleton:\nThick armor plating renders the sandshark almost immune to attack from above. While it is capable of impressive acceleration its exoskeleton prevents it from changing direction quickly. The sandhsark is thus a perfectly-designed ambush hunter, but ill-suited to sustained pursuits.\n\n3. Feet:\nIll-designed for ambulation. Likely used to disturb the surface of the sand so the lifeform can burrow into the ground.\n\nAssessment: Avoid - Be vigilant for ambush in sandy biomes",

Chitinous Shell:\nMost of the lifeform's topside and some of its underside is protected by a thick, layered exoskeleton. This suggests an evolutionary path quite different from other organisms on 4546B, most of which are vertebrate in nature. The reefback species has likely been able to grow far larger than other herbivores because anything large enough to break through its shell has long since gone extinct.\n\n2. Enzyme Pods:\nSimilar in appearance to the algae glands of the gasopod, these organs on the reefback's underside serve some unknown purpose in its digestive system, and are capable of expelling small quantities of stomach enzymes into the surrounding waters.\n\n3. Local Microcosm:\nAn array of different barnacle and plant species grow on the reefback's shell, thrusting their roots into ancient scars in the chitin, and taking advantage of their mobility to avoid predation. Nonetheless reefbacks will often be pursued by the faster, hungrier herbivores, and thus this leviathan species is a mobile microcosm worthy of years of study in itself.\n\n4.

I had Maida salvage the Degasi wreck, set Bart to finding us a stable source of food. His education is paying off sooner than I'd anticipated.\n\nOur only problem is Maida. She says the weather's going to turn. I say she's finding excuses to risk our lives. I imagine she's not gone a week in her life without a physical altercation, and she's itching for a fight. In every judgment she makes things go from bad to worse. \n\nIf she had my experience she'd have more faith. Humans have spent millennia specializing in how to shackle nature to our will. This planet won't cause us any new problems.\n\nMy one task now is to keep us alive, as comfortably as possible, until the insurance company arranges rescue.

    "EncyDesc_JellyPDAObservatory": "Something incredible just happened.\n\nSince we're down here, I had this plan to build equipment and study the incredible lifeforms we're encountering, but I didn't have enough enameled glass. So I started looking for a natural substrate that would strengthen the glass we have, and those stalker teeth we've been finding fit the bill - only, well, we needed more.\n\nThat's when Marguerit got interested. She actually listened to me - more than I can say for father - and I worked up the courage to talk about my more... tentative theories. When I told her they were attracted to metal deposits, that their teeth get dislodged when they pick them up, her eyes narrowed and she dashed out of the room.\n\nThree hours later she came back, her pack loaded down with stalker teeth! I asked her about it. She shrugged and said my theories were good. Said she had them eating out the palm of her hand. I think she meant it literally.\n\nShe is incredible. She went out to the kelp forests, armed with just a heatblade, and went fin to fin with a pack of stalkers.\n\nOn the one hand, that is the coolest thing I have ever heard. On the other, I hope the stalkers didn't come off worse than Marguerit did. She had a huge gash on her forearm. I don't think things went as smoothly as she made out. And what's the point in surviving here if we have to kill everything that makes it so wonderful?\n\nI wish I knew more about these animals, but father won't let me leave the habitat. Maybe with all this glass we could build a containment unit and get up close to them.",

He'd tell me it was childish, but I stare out the window and sometimes I think how lucky I am to see this world up close. Back on the island I wouldn't have believed the creatures that live down here. The fish, they GLOW... There's one that's 90% eyeball... Snakes twice the length of a habitat compartment.\n\nCertainly it's not all friendly. Most of the plantlife is toxic, I learned that the hard way, but I've managed to coax some marblemelons into growing indoors, and when they don't cover our dietary needs, well... we eat the fish themselves. It's a bit gross, but it's nothing they wouldn't do.\n\nI've been attempting to document my findings. Father approves. He says understanding is power. That the more we know about this planet, the more we can use it to our advantage. I'm just doing it because it's fun. It's not easy without proper equipment and network access, but the old fashioned way - observing, taking notes, testing theories - shows me the world in a way a spectroscopic analysis never could.\n\nLately I've been watching the crabsnakes. They ambush their prey as it tries to feed on the mushrooms they hide in. What they don't eat settles on the seabed, which fertilizes the mushrooms, which feeds the herbivores, and so the chain continues. Co-evolution gives me the fuzzies.",

She's got it into her head that she can save us if she just acts recklessly enough. But I've hauled starwhals to Neptune. Plasteel to the Federation... this family operates nine different mining colonies across the Ariadne Arm. Maida thinks she's better suited to lead? Her contract still says otherwise.\n\nBut... I just cannot damn tell whether it's the stupidest idea I ever heard, or my only hope. I turned 80 years old last week. I thought I had another 80 in me, but marooned on this planet there's no swapping out of my liver when the old one fails. Here, I'm mortal. And Maida is useful.\n\nSo it's my responsibility to make a decision. Return to the island and hope whatever knocked the Degasi out of the sky won't do the same to the rescue ship, or take us deeper in search of answers. And all the while be hoping old age gets me before the seamonsters do.\n\nI'll give Maida just one thing. She was right about these caves. There's enough lithium there to fabricate a hundred tons of plasteel. Enough for a damn FLEET of Cyclops submarines. There was nothing anyone could have done to avoid crashing here, but I was right to order the detour.

Or worlds where everyone's supposed to do whatever creative job they feel like! What use is learning to draw or sing in a world where there's no human resource department to co-ordinate the galleries and concerts? On Alterra worlds, psychometric testing and specialized digi-training makes the most of everyone's talents.'\n\nMax Zoinkoff: 'I started out in marketing for Alterra Survival Systems. It was good work, but I thought I could do better. I set up my own company, developing bespoke code for the Seamoth so it could operate in open space, not just underwater. I sold up to Alterra ten years ago and now it's one of the most widely used vehicles in the galaxy. Now I'm on the board of directors, and I haven't looked back.'\n\nGeorge said, 'An average day for me starts at 10am. I live in a controlled habitat on Terra 17, so everything I need is less than five minutes away. I'm a naturally empathetic person, so I took work as a companion.

    "Ency_OuterBiomeWreckLore4": "What Can We Learn From the Hive Mind of Strader VI?",
    "EncyDesc_OuterBiomeWreckLore4": "How are the 'individuals' which make up a hive mind to be categorized? Are they merely dumb components of the larger, intelligent organism; or is the larger 'mind' merely a product of the independent organisms? Can it be both?\n\nWe define organisms by their traits, but find invariably that these traits depend on those of their environment. The concept of a tadpole is meaningless without the concept of the frog it will develop into. The idea of a predator is empty without an understanding of its prey. This begs the question: if we define everything by reference to everything else, what have we actually explained?\n\nAn illustrative experiment was recently performed on the hive mind colony discovered on Strader VI. A device was placed outside the nest which would electrocute individuals approaching it. An ant colony would have lost many individuals before a basic danger signal was successfully communicated between them, resulting in 'learned' avoidance of the device. Successful, but costly.\n\nThe Strader VI colony quickly formed into two factions:\n - One attempted to move the device by brute force, sacrificing individuals as they did so\n - The second attempted to cover the device in sand.\n \nThese two goals being mutually exclusive, a fight ensued. The first faction was beaten, in virtue of their reduced numbers. The device was safely buried, and the survivors called a truce. From the perspective of the individuals, this experience must have been horrific. From the perspective of the hive mind, a nagging problem had been overcome with the most effective solution. Which perspective is the 'correct' one?\n\nWe suggest that it is neither. By attempting to fit such entities into our rigid set of concepts we are painting onto the world a false impression of concreteness and meaning, which is a reflection of our concepts of ourselves.\n\nWe describe Strader VI individuals as 'attacking' one another, just as we describe microbes in the human body. Yet the Strader colony, like the body, cannot be healthy as a whole without the 'aggressions' of its components. We describe neurons in the brain as being dumb, but brains as a whole as intelligent - but when an idea takes hold in the brain, and forces out inferior ones, do we describe this as an act of aggression? Do we mourn dead neurons?\n\nWhen a philosophy, or a technology takes hold in human society... when wars are fought over them and people die... is that rightly seen as being good, or evil? This is not to undermine the meaning of our existence. From where we stand, our existence is very serious indeed. But is our civilization, and our universe, really any different from the colony on Strader VI? Is intelligence something limited to things of flesh and blood? Or is the universe truly one giant intelligent system, and we but amoeba blowing self-important potholes in its surface?\n\nWe would do well, as scientists, to remember that our goal is not to paint the world as we see it, but to see it as it truly is.",

    "TerrainSystemInformationText": "Subnautica uses a voxel terrain system that stores information in batches. Each batch is a 160m wide cube, and the world is made up of about 12,500 of them.\n\nThe development team is constantly working on these batches. New caves are carved, ravines cut out, Kelp Forests planted, and rock formations sculpted.\n\nSubnautica is updated frequently. If Experimental branch is played, it is updated three times per day! Saved games need to work across multiple game versions. Otherwise, as soon as the development team released an update, the saved game would be lost.\n\nMost saved game information can survive an update. For example, an inventory containing two oxygen tanks can survive if a new type of craftable diving suit is added to the game.\n\nOther information can't survive an update. For example, suppose a seabase is built on a cliff, and suppose the development team works on the batch containing that cliff, raising the cliff height.\n\nIf that save game is loaded, the seabase will be stuck inside the cliff. Not only will the base be inaccessible, but the player might be stuck in there too, and all hell will break loose inside Subnautica's game logic.\n\nTo solve this problem, every saved game retains its own copy of terrain data. This data stores the world as it was when that game was started, along with any modifications made by a player (For example, digging sand to create a cave).\n\nAs new updates are released, the saved game receives new features, items, creatures, and so on. But it never receives new terrain. This is often ok. In the case of major updates, it is not.\n\nNew game systems and items included in this update depend on the data contained in new terrain batches. If a an old saved game tries to play current version, it will not work properly and might even crash Subnautica completely.\n\nThis is why old saved games must be upgraded to play the game. Therefore some terrain batches are forced to update, allowing the new update to function. Any stuff (such as seabases) placed in these batches is destroyed by this process, to avoid the stuck-in-a-cliff scenario described above.\n\nHowever, the upgrade is not perfect. Depending on specific circumstances, it is possible that gaps could open up in terrain, or systems fail to function perfectly. In addition, the upgrade does not include all the new terrain data from the rest of the world.\n\n To play with an entirely up to date world, it is necessary to start a new game. The choice is yours. Regardless of your choice, thank you for participating in Subnautica Early Access. You are quite literally watching an alien ocean world grow before your eyes. This saved game upgrade process is a prime example of that growth.",

From there the command crew will pilot the ship beyond the final phasegate, arriving in the next solar system approximately 18 months later.\n\nThere the elite team of engineers will begin a 6 month construction project on the new phasegate, a multi-trillion credit investment. In the absence of existing infrastructure in the region, the vessel is equipped with advanced thermal and nuclear power facilities.\n\nAlterra Corp. currently operates 9% of all phasegates in the galaxy.

Reproduction\nLarge, ovary-like organs are carried in the creature's middle section, suggesting that like other species on this planet it produces eggs, however internal scar tissue indicates probable infertility.\n\n3. Enzyme 42\nThe emperor manufactures Enzyme 42 within its stomach cavity to break down its food, and will occasionally expel it into the surrounding waters. This substance was found to neutralize the effects of the bacterium, and its presence in the ecosystem today would explain how life on the planet survived the outbreak. It would remain to be explained by what mechanism the enzyme is being delivered.\n\n4.

Olfactory Stalk:\nWhile the red-tipped protrusion on the blighter's head once served as sensory apparatus, it has adapted not to chase but to coax its prey into its path. As prey creatures are attracted to the dancing of the stalk, the blighter can dart forward to catch and consume them.\n\n2. Teeth:\nOne row of sharp, piercing teeth is all the blighter needs to tear through its prey.\n\n3. Eyes:\nThis creature has found little use for eyes in the deep, dark caverns it inhabits, and its eyeballs are likely sensitive to nothing more than broad fluctuations in local lightsources (eg when a meal is crossing its path).\n\nAssessment: Avoid or incapacitate",

Limbs:\nFive legs, two arms and a large flipper allow the rockgrub to cling to and walk across rock faces in search of food, and swiftly swim to safety when under attack.\n\n3. Green Luminescence:\nGlowing green in the dark would seem like a poor survival strategy, but this adaptation may be a mating behavior or other specialized process, engaged in by only a fraction of the total population at any one time. Or perhaps being eaten is simply part of the rockgrub's lifecycle.\n\nAssessment: Harmless",

Torso:\nThe blood crawler can lower its entire body to bring its mandibles within grasping distance of the carrion on which it feeds, while retaining the maneuverability it requires to avoid its predators.\n\nAssessment: Necessary waste recycler - Avoid or incapacitate",

It likely developed photosensitive skin on each side, which over time became eyeballs, and allowed it to detect the presence of nearby threats more efficiently than other prey fish. As the species grew in number it expanded to new territories, developing into subspecies like the eyeye and the reginald.\n\nModern day features of the peeper such as its twin expulsion tubes and powerful fins are quite recent adaptations, supporting the theory that life on 4546B underwent a period of rapid evolution in recent millenia in response to an external threat.\n\nAssessment: Extinct",

Eggs discovered in the wild are in some form of natural stasis, likely awaiting ideal conditions in which to hatch, or the delivery of some vital enzyme which will kick start the process.\n\nIt is impossible to calculate the species of the egg from the exterior, however it may be possible to stimulate a hatching response if an egg is relocated to a suitable alien containment unit.",
