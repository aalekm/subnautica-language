    "EncyDesc_CuteFish": "A small, gray-colored herbivore, the cuddlefish displays high levels of intelligence, curiosity and attachment. Strangely this species has not been encountered in the wild, and the scanned specimen had to be artificially hatched within an alien containment unit. \n\n1. Lifecycle:\nIn the absence of wild specimens little can be known for certain about the cuddlefish's lifecycle. It is possible that environmental conditions have changed, forcing the species to the edge of extinction, and leaving its eggs in permanent stasis. It is also possible the cuddelfish has been genetically altered, or even imported to 4546B from another world.\n\n2. Behavior:\nWe do know that the cuddlefish is a herbivore which displays highly social behavior in its interspecies interactions. As was observed in earth dolphins before their extinction, this creature seems to understand the concept of other minds, the prime indicator of true sentience, and attempts to communicate with a series of chirps and chirrups.\n\n3. Interaction:\nEvidence suggests the cuddlefish is capable of understanding and following simple commands, in addition to assessing the emotional state of individuals around it and responding in kind.\n\nAssessment: Emotional connection between living creatures is an essential component of psychological health",

Construct useful interior modules like radios, rechargers and storage solutions\n\nPrimary habitat systems like oxygen generation and flood control, as well as modules like the fabricator draw power and will not function without it. Additional compartments reduce overall hull integrity, depending on the external pressure. \n\n'Quick-Build Habitats: A home far, far away from home.'",

    "EncyDesc_JellyPDAObservatory": "Something incredible just happened.\n\nSince we're down here, I had this plan to build equipment and study the incredible lifeforms we're encountering, but I didn't have enough enameled glass. So I started looking for a natural substrate that would strengthen the glass we have, and those stalker teeth we've been finding fit the bill - only, well, we needed more.\n\nThat's when Marguerit got interested. She actually listened to me - more than I can say for father - and I worked up the courage to talk about my more... tentative theories. When I told her they were attracted to metal deposits, that their teeth get dislodged when they pick them up, her eyes narrowed and she dashed out of the room.\n\nThree hours later she came back, her pack loaded down with stalker teeth! I asked her about it. She shrugged and said my theories were good. Said she had them eating out the palm of her hand. I think she meant it literally.\n\nShe is incredible. She went out to the kelp forests, armed with just a heatblade, and went fin to fin with a pack of stalkers.\n\nOn the one hand, that is the coolest thing I have ever heard. On the other, I hope the stalkers didn't come off worse than Marguerit did. She had a huge gash on her forearm. I don't think things went as smoothly as she made out. And what's the point in surviving here if we have to kill everything that makes it so wonderful?\n\nI wish I knew more about these animals, but father won't let me leave the habitat. Maybe with all this glass we could build a containment unit and get up close to them.",

He'd tell me it was childish, but I stare out the window and sometimes I think how lucky I am to see this world up close. Back on the island I wouldn't have believed the creatures that live down here. The fish, they GLOW... There's one that's 90% eyeball... Snakes twice the length of a habitat compartment.\n\nCertainly it's not all friendly. Most of the plantlife is toxic, I learned that the hard way, but I've managed to coax some marblemelons into growing indoors, and when they don't cover our dietary needs, well... we eat the fish themselves. It's a bit gross, but it's nothing they wouldn't do.\n\nI've been attempting to document my findings. Father approves. He says understanding is power. That the more we know about this planet, the more we can use it to our advantage. I'm just doing it because it's fun. It's not easy without proper equipment and network access, but the old fashioned way - observing, taking notes, testing theories - shows me the world in a way a spectroscopic analysis never could.\n\nLately I've been watching the crabsnakes. They ambush their prey as it tries to feed on the mushrooms they hide in. What they don't eat settles on the seabed, which fertilizes the mushrooms, which feeds the herbivores, and so the chain continues. Co-evolution gives me the fuzzies.",

She's got it into her head that she can save us if she just acts recklessly enough. But I've hauled starwhals to Neptune. Plasteel to the Federation... this family operates nine different mining colonies across the Ariadne Arm. Maida thinks she's better suited to lead? Her contract still says otherwise.\n\nBut... I just cannot damn tell whether it's the stupidest idea I ever heard, or my only hope. I turned 80 years old last week. I thought I had another 80 in me, but marooned on this planet there's no swapping out of my liver when the old one fails. Here, I'm mortal. And Maida is useful.\n\nSo it's my responsibility to make a decision. Return to the island and hope whatever knocked the Degasi out of the sky won't do the same to the rescue ship, or take us deeper in search of answers. And all the while be hoping old age gets me before the seamonsters do.\n\nI'll give Maida just one thing. She was right about these caves. There's enough lithium there to fabricate a hundred tons of plasteel. Enough for a damn FLEET of Cyclops submarines. There was nothing anyone could have done to avoid crashing here, but I was right to order the detour.

    "EncyDesc_SeaTreader": "A vast bipedal leviathan which roams the reefs in herds, grazing the seafloor.\n\n1. Antennae:\nAntennae on the creature's head can detect a range of scents, helping the sea treaders to find fresh grazing pastures, avoid the path of large predators, and sense chemical signals from others of their kind.\n\n2. Carapace:\nThick armour protects the creature from attack by all but the largest of carnivores. Two legs extend from the rear.\n\n3. Elongated Snout:\nUsed to siphon up plant material from the sea floor, and maintain balance.\n\n4. Behavior:\nLarge herds would decimate the flora of a single area, thus encouraging the sea treader's migratory behavior. Families keep their young towards the center of the herd, and parents will lash out at over curious interlopers in search of an easy meal.\n\nAssessment: Sea treader herds may unearth mineral deposits as they churn up the sand",

    "EncyDesc_ReaperLeviathan": "Leviathan class species are vast organisms at the top of their respective food chains. This species is a streamlined hunter, with highly developed senses.\n\n1. Powerful Mandibles:\nThis leviathan is capable of locking prey in place with four powerful mandibles, and drawing it within reach of its jaws. Simulated pressure exceeds Seamoth crush resistance.\n\n2. Echolocation:\nThe deep roar emitted by the reaper at regular intervals is effectively sonar - if you can hear it, the reaper can see you.\n\n3. Profile:\nScanned specimen measured 55m long. Observed circling its prey and attacking from behind. This creature is almost all muscle. Very little brain. No sense of morality. Just muscle, synapses and teeth.\n\nMotivational note: Congratulations on getting close enough to scan it and living to see the results!\n\nAssessment: Extreme threat - Avoid in all circumstances",

    "EncyDesc_Crabsquid": "This large predator can be found in deep waters, where it lurks amongst the blood kelp and membrain trees in search of prey. It can deploy a powerful electromagnetic pulse to defend itself.\n\n1. Limbs:\n10 limbs feature different appendages for swimming, walking, hunting, and possibly even tool use. Creatures caught in its grasp are expertly butchered and quickly consumed.\n\n2. Behavior:\nRays and other illuminated herbivores are its usual prey, and it will approach and attack any light source in the vicinity. Its EMP blast was likely developed as a response to predation by creatures with electrical hunting mechanisms.\n\n3. Intelligence:\nWhile crabsquids appear to have large brains and a resemblance to the intelligent squids of earth, the organ inside the creature's head is in fact its stomach, which it must fill with startling regularity.\n\nAssessment: Neutralizes electrical equipment - Lights attract its (unwanted) attention",

They go into a classroom every day, they memorize things, then later they type those things out in controlled environments. Or worlds where everyone's supposed to do whatever creative job they feel like! What use is learning to draw or sing in a world where there's no human resource department to co-ordinate the galleries and concerts? On Alterra worlds, psychometric testing and specialized digi-training makes the most of everyone's talents.'\n\nMax Zoinkoff: 'I started out in marketing for Alterra Survival Systems. It was good work, but I thought I could do better. I set up my own company, developing bespoke code for the Seamoth so it could operate in open space, not just underwater. I sold up to Alterra ten years ago and now it's one of the most widely used vehicles in the galaxy. Now I'm on the board of directors, and I haven't looked back.'\n\nGeorge said, 'An average day for me starts at 10am. I live in a controlled habitat on Terra 17, so everything I need is less than five minutes away. I'm a naturally empathetic person, so I took work as a companion. I spend my days visiting clients, talking with them, learning about them, paying them the attention that everyone needs and deserves, and like everyone on Alterra worlds I'm lucky enough to earn a living doing things I enjoy.'\n\nKaz says, 'We're lucky. We're free. We have jobs. There are trans-govs out there that do everything with robots, you know?'",

By combining ancient meditative practices with the foresight of modern science, unificationist pantheism was born.\n\nDeterminism teaches us that what has always been, always will be. The future is already decided, and free will is a myth. Gone are the days of casting guilt and original sin on all. Today we understand that we are born innocent, into lives we are not responsible for; we are atoms vibrating in the energy winds of space. Understanding that what we do has no meaning but for ourselves; and understanding that we are just as much a causal part of the universe as the universe is a causal part of us; we can understand that we give meaning to the universe and the universe gives meaning to us. We are people. But we are also gods.\n\nIf we are gods, why do we feel imperfect? If there is no authority but our own, why do people keep telling us what to do?\n\nUnificationism has the answer. 300 credits for the opening seminar.",

Are they merely dumb components of the larger, intelligent organism; or is the larger 'mind' merely a product of the independent organisms? Can it be both?\n\nWe define organisms by their traits, but find invariably that these traits depend on those of their environment. The concept of a tadpole is meaningless without the concept of the frog it will develop into. The idea of a predator is empty without an understanding of its prey. This begs the question: if we define everything by reference to everything else, what have we actually explained?\n\nAn illustrative experiment was recently performed on the hive mind colony discovered on Strader VI. A device was placed outside the nest which would electrocute individuals approaching it. An ant colony would have lost many individuals before a basic danger signal was successfully communicated between them, resulting in 'learned' avoidance of the device. Successful, but costly.\n\nThe Strader VI colony quickly formed into two factions:\n - One attempted to move the device by brute force, sacrificing individuals as they did so\n - The second attempted to cover the device in sand.\n \nThese two goals being mutually exclusive, a fight ensued. The first faction was beaten, in virtue of their reduced numbers. The device was safely buried, and the survivors called a truce. From the perspective of the individuals, this experience must have been horrific. From the perspective of the hive mind, a nagging problem had been overcome with the most effective solution. Which perspective is the 'correct' one?\n\nWe suggest that it is neither. By attempting to fit such entities into our rigid set of concepts we are painting onto the world a false impression of concreteness and meaning, which is a reflection of our concepts of ourselves.\n\nWe describe Strader VI individuals as 'attacking' one another, just as we describe microbes in the human body. Yet the Strader colony, like the body, cannot be healthy as a whole without the 'aggressions' of its components. We describe neurons in the brain as being dumb, but brains as a whole as intelligent - but when an idea takes hold in the brain, and forces out inferior ones, do we describe this as an act of aggression? Do we mourn dead neurons?\n\nWhen a philosophy, or a technology takes hold in human society... when wars are fought over them and people die... is that rightly seen as being good, or evil? This is not to undermine the meaning of our existence. From where we stand, our existence is very serious indeed. But is our civilization, and our universe, really any different from the colony on Strader VI? Is intelligence something limited to things of flesh and blood? Or is the universe truly one giant intelligent system, and we but amoeba blowing self-important potholes in its surface?\n\nWe would do well, as scientists, to remember that our goal is not to paint the world as we see it, but to see it as it truly is.",

    "TerrainSystemInformationText": "Subnautica uses a voxel terrain system that stores information in batches. Each batch is a 160m wide cube, and the world is made up of about 12,500 of them.\n\nThe development team is constantly working on these batches. New caves are carved, ravines cut out, Kelp Forests planted, and rock formations sculpted.\n\nSubnautica is updated frequently. If Experimental branch is played, it is updated three times per day! Saved games need to work across multiple game versions. Otherwise, as soon as the development team released an update, the saved game would be lost.\n\nMost saved game information can survive an update. For example, an inventory containing two oxygen tanks can survive if a new type of craftable diving suit is added to the game.\n\nOther information can't survive an update. For example, suppose a seabase is built on a cliff, and suppose the development team works on the batch containing that cliff, raising the cliff height.\n\nIf that save game is loaded, the seabase will be stuck inside the cliff. Not only will the base be inaccessible, but the player might be stuck in there too, and all hell will break loose inside Subnautica's game logic.\n\nTo solve this problem, every saved game retains its own copy of terrain data. This data stores the world as it was when that game was started, along with any modifications made by a player (For example, digging sand to create a cave).\n\nAs new updates are released, the saved game receives new features, items, creatures, and so on. But it never receives new terrain. This is often ok. In the case of major updates, it is not.\n\nNew game systems and items included in this update depend on the data contained in new terrain batches. If a an old saved game tries to play current version, it will not work properly and might even crash Subnautica completely.\n\nThis is why old saved games must be upgraded to play the game. Therefore some terrain batches are forced to update, allowing the new update to function. Any stuff (such as seabases) placed in these batches is destroyed by this process, to avoid the stuck-in-a-cliff scenario described above.\n\nHowever, the upgrade is not perfect. Depending on specific circumstances, it is possible that gaps could open up in terrain, or systems fail to function perfectly. In addition, the upgrade does not include all the new terrain data from the rest of the world.\n\n To play with an entirely up to date world, it is necessary to start a new game. The choice is yours. Regardless of your choice, thank you for participating in Subnautica Early Access. You are quite literally watching an alien ocean world grow before your eyes. This saved game upgrade process is a prime example of that growth.",

Lack of Beak:\nWhile the peeper uses its beak to break down tough corals, the oculus likely feeds on the soft fungal growths of the jellyshroom caves and thus has no need of one.\n\n3. Separated Tail Fin:\nThe caves in which the oculus lives make it hard to escape from fast predators. The oculus has adapted by splitting its tail fin into five separate tendrils.  These tendrils prevent it from swimming as fast as its shallow-water cousin, but each can be detached and regrown, enabling it to escape more easily when caught.\n\nAssessment: Edible",

    "EncyDesc_Crabsnake": "This lifeform appears to live in symbiosis with the local flora. All encountered specimens have been located within 50m of jellyshroom flora, frequently within the plants themselves.\n\n1. Jaws:\nThe crabsnake has two pairs of fangs, and one larger claw on either side. It plunges these claws into its prey, locking them in place while the inner jaw tears through the flesh.\n\n2. Jellyshroom Symbiosis:\nJellyshrooms provide the perfect lair from which to ambush their prey, and protect their young. The presence of crabsnakes likely deters herbivores from feeding on the jellyshroom itself, thus ensuring the relationship continues.\n\n3. Behavior:\nCrabsnakes display territorial behavior when threatened, patrolling the cave systems in which they reside.\n    \nAssessment: Avoid",

Semi-permeable Bladder:\nThe bladderfish is able to filter air and seawater into its body cavity through a unique membrane which surrounds its spine like a bladder. This allows it to remove and consume organic particulate caught on the way, and adjust its buoyancy.\n\n2. Open-ended Vascular Tubing:\nCan be angled and contracted to pump out water and achieve low-velocity, guided propulsion.\n\nLargely oblivious to threats, and practically immobile at night, its only identified defense mechanism is that it's composed almost entirely of water, air and cartilage.\n\nAssessment: Edible (oxygen may be retrieved from the bladder and added to tanks on consumption); membrane has applications as a natural water filter",

Marguerit, I can't find out how they resist the bacteria if you SLAUGHTER them all.\n\nMARGUERIT: It ain't always they oblige in coming in alive.\n\nPAUL: He means you're being reckless.\n\nBART: Father, the outcome's no better if we hole up in here and don't go outside. We have to find a middle way.\n\nPAUL: There is no compromise!

I said others would come. \n\nThe rupture threw me clear of the habitat, and the monster turned and bore down on me. Just as its tentacles came within reach, Maida appeared out of nowhere. She had a seaglide in one hand, a jagged piece of scrap metal in the other. She meant to butcher that beast, or die trying. The last I saw her she had the metal lodged in its neck as the monster did its best to shake her, contorting off into the darkness. I'm certain she got her wish, one way or another.\n\nThen I thought I saw a light, deep below me. I hoped maybe Bart had swum clear. I followed it. Now I wonder whether I saw anything at all. My oxygen is low. The habitat is gone. I can't see the sky. Something surely has the scent of my blood.",

Semi-permeable Bladder:\nThe bladderfish is able to filter air and seawater into its body cavity through a unique membrane which surrounds its spine like a bladder. This allows it to remove and consume organic particulate caught on the way, and adjust its buoyancy.\n\n2. Open-ended Vascular Tubing:\nCan be angled and contracted to pump out water and achieve low-velocity, guided propulsion.\n\nLargely oblivious to threats, and practically immobile at night, its only identified defense mechanism is that it's composed almost entirely of water, air and cartilage.\n\nAssessment: Edible (oxygen may be retrieved from the bladder and added to tanks on consumption); membrane has applications as a natural water filter",

The scanned specimen measured 112m in length.\n\n1. Heat-Proof Tissue:\nTissue analysis reveals this specimen consists of 1\/3 inanimate materials, focused around the chest area. Consumption and retention of mineral substances may explain the lifeform's ability to withstand extremes of temperature. It even appears to be able to consume molten materials and expel them at its adversaries.\n\n2. Forearms:\nEvolutionarily distinct forearms are used for both propulsion and offensive purposes. Finding suggests evolutionary divergence from other species on the planet tens of millions of years ago. The sea dragon is likely one of the oldest species on the planet.\n\n3. Behavior:\nAs the largest carnivorous species encountered on 4546B, almost everything is potential prey. With few substantial targets in the volcanic cave systems the sea dragon likely ventures out into cooler waters to hunt other, smaller leviathans, cornering them and forcing them deeper, where they are ultimately boiled alive.\n\nThe sea dragons' size and the restrictions of the cave systems they inhabit suggest their population numbers are extremely low, perhaps in the single digits. While it is not unusual for larger predators to sustain lower populations, it is possible the sea dragon's food sources have diminished over time. This species may be nearing extinction.\n\nAssessment: Extreme threat - Avoid in all circumstances",

Thermal Vision:\nDelicate, light-based eyesight is impractical at these temperatures, and the red eyeye has developed thermal vision in its place. In this species' volcanic domain edible plant matter and potential predators are the coldest entities in range.\n\nAssessment: Edible (low calorie count)",

Reproduction\nLarge, ovary-like organs are carried in the creature's middle section, suggesting that like other species on this planet it produces eggs, however internal scar tissue indicates probable infertility.\n\n3. Enzyme 42\nThe emperor manufactures Enzyme 42 within its stomach cavity to break down its food, and will occasionally expel it into the surrounding waters. This substance was found to neutralize the effects of the bacterium, and its presence in the ecosystem today would explain how life on the planet survived the outbreak. It would remain to be explained by what mechanism the enzyme is being delivered.\n\n4. Health\nComparative analysis of size and metabolic rates indicates the specimen captured by the researchers was approximately 1,600 years old. Extensive internal and external scar tissue suggest it had lived well in excess of the peak lifespan for its species.\n\nAssessment: While a healthy emperor specimen may have held some potential as a cure, it is unlikely any research subjects survived quarantine procedures.",

Offspring would likely split off at a young age to form their own herds elsewhere.\n\nGiven their sparse population, mating and egg-laying was likely infrequent, perhaps a once in a lifetime event.

Given the rarity of this event, it is impossible to calculate those conditions precisely.\n\nThere is no evidence to support the assumption that all members of the species were immune from the alien bacterium. Even if this is so, there is evidence that introduction of the bacterium decimated life on the planet, and this would have had catastrophic effects on the emperors' food supply and survival rate. \n\nThe symbiotic relationship between this specimen and other lifeforms likely developed as a direct result of the bacterial infection.

Adults of the species have been encountered exclusively around the edges of the volcanic crater which supports life on this part of the planet, and react with extreme aggression on approach.\n\n1. Hammerhead:\nCartilaginous extensions of the creature's skull form a hammerhead which protects the ghost leviathan as it performs devastating ramming attacks.\n\n2. Jaws:\nWhile fully capable of tearing through the flesh of any creature in range, all evidence indicates that mature ghost leviathans feed on microscopic lifeforms in the waters around the edges of the inhabited zone. Their vicious attacks on interlopers to their domain are not predatory in nature, but territorial. A creature so vast requires a huge expanse of water to satisfy its daily calorie requirements.\n\n3. Torso:\nIts muscled interior body is surrounded by a translucent outer membrane, suggesting adaptation for deep, low-light environments. When threatened it can tense its entire body before lashing out with incredible speed.\n\n4. Lifecycle:\nProbable migratory behavior. This specimen was likely born far from the area where it was encountered.\n\nAssessment: Extreme threat - Avoid the crater edge",

Diet:\nIn its juvenile state this leviathan feeds on larger herbivores, and unfortunate members of its own species. They display a remarkable rate of growth which shows no signs of stopping, suggesting that they must abandon their hatching grounds before they grow too large and make for more open waters.\n\nAssessment: Avoid",

Those individuals fortunate enough to attach to a digestible nutrient source will grow in size, thus increasing their buoyancy and drawing whatever they are attached to closer to the surface. \n\nIn extreme circumstances a number of floaters may attach to a leviathan class lifeform, forcing it to the surface and effectively asphyxiating it. The body will be consumed over a number of months until eventually dissolving, leaving the floaters free to attach to a new host.\n\nThose creatures which successfully raise a landmass to the surface are rewarded with a burgeoning and permanent food supply, allowing them finally to reproduce and begin the cycle again.\n\nAssessment: Incredible",

As the species grew in number it expanded to new territories, developing into subspecies like the eyeye and the reginald.\n\nModern day features of the peeper such as its twin expulsion tubes and powerful fins are quite recent adaptations, supporting the theory that life on 4546B underwent a period of rapid evolution in recent millenia in response to an external threat.\n\nAssessment: Extinct",
